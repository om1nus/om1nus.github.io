    happen to take place in the game. It shows to have three main (storyline) protagonists: Michael, who is a retired bank robber who faked his death

    <p class="AboutFontStyle">About Cayo Perico?</p>
    <p class="AboutOminusFontLetter">Cayo Perico is an anticipated and hyped up DLC and is releasing (released) at 15/12/2020 and should be jam-packed with
        things to do. According to the publishers a new immersive island shall be releasing in the heist and can be played by a single player! The main character
        of the heist and who rules the island is........ Pablo Escobar no just kidding it is instead the notorious Drug Leader 'El Rubio', who appears as the main
        antagonist of the Cayo Perico Heist. He is also the supplier to the Martin Madrazo family. 'El Rubio' isn't his real name and his real name still has not
        been confirmed yet and as in the trailer mentioned as a 'John Doe' type character. The ten second teaser of the Cayo Perico Heist DLC composed of the view
        of 'John Doe' dead at Vespucci Beach. Yes, 'El Rubio' is actually meant to be inspired by Pablo Escobar (who also owned a huge island), just like how in the
        story-mode of GTA V the inventor of 'Life Invader' is also meant to represent Mark Zuckerburg (developer of Facebook) or in the Doomsday Heist, Avon Hertz
        with a similiar resemblance of Elon Musk.
